# Cine Nights

This project is a redux implementation of my old [Cine Nights Vanilla](https://github.com/davesahaj/cine-nights-vanilla).

Cine nights is an open source watch party application that allows you to create a streaming server and lets you watch your favourite movies with others without any login.

### `npm start`

Runs the backend server in the development mode on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

In the project frontend directory, run:

### `npm start`
